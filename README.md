# Flashcards [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rohellec/flashcards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rohellec/flashcards) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rohellec/flashcards/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rohellec/flashcards)

This is a web application prototype for flashcards (also known as [*anki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) cards).
Flashcards are often used for memorizing foreign words, unknown word definitions
etc.
The basic mechanism is very simple - you write the word on one side of the card and its definition or translation on the other.
Then after rotating the cards you pick several of them and looking at the word try to guess what does it mean.
The more often you rotate the cards, the better you memorize the words!
